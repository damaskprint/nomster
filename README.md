 # Nomster

 This application was made to use features like other popular apps that rate a particular site. To make a comment or add a location in the database, a user account will need to be created. All locations, ratings, and comments are saved and displayed in the user's account.
 The App was created with Ruby on Rails and the Google Maps API.
